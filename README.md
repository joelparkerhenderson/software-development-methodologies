## Agile

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development

Agile Manifesto:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

* Working software over comprehensive documentation

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

* Responding to change over following a plan

Principles:

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Scaled agile framework

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_agile_framework

Principles:

* Take an economic view

* Apply systems thinking

* Assume variability; preserve options

* Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles

* Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems

* Visualize and limit work-in-progress, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue lengths

* Apply cadence (timing), synchronize with cross-domain planning

* Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers

* Decentralize decision-making


## Scrum 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)

Key roles:

* A "customer voice" a.k.a. "product owner role". This role that represents the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer. The product hat creates roadmaps, is accountable for the backlog, and maximising the value that team delivers to the business. The product hat defines the product in customer-centric terms such as user stories, adds them to the product backlog, and prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies.

* A "team voice" a.k.a. "scrum master role". This role is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables. The role is not a traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The role has also been referred to as a team facilitator or servant-leader.

* A "delivery team" a.k.a. that does all tasks required to build the product increments (analysis, design, development, testing, documentation). The team is multi-disciplinary; the team is not just programmers.


## Disciplined agile delivery

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplined_agile_delivery

Key aspects:

* People-first

* Learning-oriented

* Hybrid

* Full delivery lifecycle

* Process goal driven

* Solution focused

* Risk-value lifecycle

* Enterprise aware

Primary roles:

* Stakeholder

* Product Owner

* Team Member

* Team Lead

* Architecture Owner

Secondary roles:

* Specialist

* Domain Expert

* Technical Expert

* Independent Tester

* Integrator


## Sprints

Calendar time sprint:

  * A "calendar time sprint" aims for given amount of time, such as one month, then tries to choose work that can fit into the time.

  * Example: A team decides to do a monthly sprint, then looks at all the potential work to do, and does a planning session to choose the work that is likely to fit into the time. 

Customer value sprint:

  * A "customer value sprint" aims for a business goal, such as delivering a new feature, and then gives options for scheduling time and resources.

  * Example: there is a customer cohort that will pay more when the product has a new feature. The team estimates the work, and then works on it.

Internal value sprint:

  * An "internal value sprint" aims for an infrastructure goal, such as refactoring, replatforming, or research.

  * Example: the team wants to change the code from using one kind of code to another kind, or from one hosting company to another, or from internally-built code to vendor-built code. The team estimates the work, and then works on it.


## Six thinking hats

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats

The six thinking hats are described as a role and a hat color:

  * Managing = Blue. What is the subject? what are we thinking about? what is the goal? Can look at the big picture.
  * Information = White. Consider purely what information is available; what are the facts?
  * Emotions = Red. Intuitive or instinctive gut reactions or statements of emotional feeling (but not any justification).
  * Discernment = Black. Logic applied to identifying reasons to be cautious and conservative. Practical, realistic.
  * Optimistic response = Yellow. Logic applied to identifying benefits, seeking harmony. Sees the brighter, sunny side of situations.
  * Creativity = Green. Statements of provocation and investigation, seeing where a thought goes. Thinks creatively, outside the box.
